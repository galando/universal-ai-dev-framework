# PIV Development Rules

Follow these rules for all code in this project.

## Workflow Rules

- **ONE file** at a time → modify → test → commit → then next
- **ONE task** at a time → complete → verify → then next
- **NEVER** batch multiple files or changes together
- **ASK** before starting: "Should I break this into smaller tasks?"

## Core Principles

- **Understand first**: Use `Read` tool on existing code before modifying
- **Match patterns**: Follow existing codebase conventions
- **Minimal changes**: Only change what's necessary
- **Self-documenting**: Clear names over comments

## DRY & KISS

- Check for existing implementations before creating new
- Prefer simple over clever solutions
- Single source of truth for each piece of knowledge

## When Completing Work

**ASK**: "Shall I commit this change?"
