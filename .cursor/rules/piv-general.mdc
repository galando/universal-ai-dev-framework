# PIV Development Rules

Follow these rules for all code in this project.

## 🛑 WORKFLOW RULES (READ FIRST)

### One Feature at a Time
- **ONE file** → modify → test → commit → then next file
- **ONE task** → complete → verify → then next task
- **NEVER** create multiple files simultaneously
- **NEVER** batch "similar" changes together

### Stop and Verify
- After EACH file change: **ASK** if user wants to test/commit
- After EACH task: **WAIT** for user confirmation
- After EACH phase: **SHOW** what was changed

### When User Says "Implement X"
1. **ASK**: "Should I break this into smaller tasks?"
2. **LIST** the files/changes needed
3. **CONFIRM** before starting
4. **WORK** on one file at a time
5. **PAUSE** after each file for user review

---

## Core Principles

### Understand First
- **ALWAYS** read existing code before modifying
- **ASK** about unclear patterns
- **MATCH** existing code style

### Match Patterns
- Follow existing codebase conventions
- Reuse existing patterns (DRY)
- Don't introduce "your preferred way"

### Minimal Changes
- **ONE** logical change per file
- **NO** "while I'm here" refactoring
- **FOCUS** on the requested task only

### Self-Documenting
- Clear names over comments
- Obvious code doesn't need explanation
- Comments explain "why", not "what"

---

## DRY & KISS

- Check for existing implementations before creating new
- Prefer simple over clever solutions
- Single source of truth for each piece of knowledge
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It

---

## When Completing Work

**ALWAYS** ask: "Shall I commit this change?"

**NEVER** say "I also fixed X, Y, Z while I was at it" unless explicitly asked.
