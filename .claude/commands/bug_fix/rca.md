# Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

## Issue Tracker Detection

**First, detect the issue tracker type from `$ARGUMENTS`:**

**Read detection logic:**
```bash
Read .claude/lib/issue-tracker/detector.md
```

**Auto-detected formats:**

| Input Format | Detected Tracker | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123` | GitHub | Full URL |
| `#123` or `123` | GitHub | Hash prefix or plain number |
| `PROJ-123` | Jira | Standard Jira key |
| `PROJ-123@https://jira.example.com` | Jira | Jira key with custom instance |
| `jira:PROJ-123` | Jira | Explicit jira: prefix |
| `direct:<description>` | Direct | No tracker |

**Set these variables for use throughout RCA:**
- `$TRACKER_TYPE` - "github" | "jira" | "direct"
- `$ISSUE_KEY` - Issue identifier (PROJ-123 or 123)
- `$JIRA_INSTANCE` - Jira base URL (if applicable)

## Bug Source

Determine the source and analyze accordingly:

**Option 1: GitHub Issue**
```
$ARGUMENTS
```
Example: `https://github.com/your-org/repo/issues/123` or just `123` or `#123`

**Option 2: Jira Ticket**
```
$ARGUMENTS
```
Example: `PROJ-123`, `PROJ-123@https://jira.example.com`, or `jira:PROJ-123`

**Option 3: Direct Bug Description**
```
direct:Bug description here
```
Example: `direct:Properties with special characters in address cause geocoding to fail`

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis document for a bug or issue.

**Goal:** Understand the problem deeply before implementing a fix.

## RCA Process

### 1. Understand the Issue

**Read tracker-specific operations:**
```bash
# GitHub operations
Read .claude/lib/issue-tracker/github.md

# Jira operations
Read .claude/lib/issue-tracker/jira.md

# Formatter for branch/commit patterns
Read .claude/lib/issue-tracker/formatter.md
```

**If analyzing a GitHub Issue (`$TRACKER_TYPE = "github"`):**
- Issue title and number
- Issue description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots/logs if provided
- Labels, milestones, assignee
- Use `gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,state,labels,comments` to get full issue details

**If analyzing a Jira Ticket (`$TRACKER_TYPE = "jira"`):**
- Issue key and summary
- Issue description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Attachments/screenshots if provided
- Priority, status, assignee
- **Fetch using (in order of preference):**
  1. **MCP Server** (if available): Use Jira MCP tools
  2. **jira-cli** (fallback): `jira issue view "$ISSUE_KEY" --plain`
  3. **Manual** (graceful degradation): Proceed with issue key only, gather context manually

**If analyzing a direct bug description (`$TRACKER_TYPE = "direct"`):**
- Parse the bug description from user input
- Ask clarifying questions if needed:
  - What is the expected behavior?
  - What is the actual behavior?
  - How can this be reproduced?
  - What is the impact (critical/high/medium/low)?
  - Which users or use cases are affected?
- Gather additional context:
  - When did this start happening?
  - Was it working before?
  - Any recent changes that might have caused it?

**Clarify Ambiguities:**
- If description is unclear, ask questions
- Get reproduction steps if missing
- Understand the impact (critical/high/medium/low)
- Identify affected users or use cases
